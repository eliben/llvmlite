Patched LLVM 3.5:
The binaries from the numba binstar channel use a patched LLVM3.5 for fixing
a LLVM ELF relocation bug that is caused by the use of 32-bit relative offset
in 64-bit binaries.  The problem appears to occur more often on hardened
kernels, like in CentOS.  The patched source code is available at:
https://github.com/numba/llvm-mirror/releases/tag/3.5p1
